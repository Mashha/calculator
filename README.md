# Calculator

## Introduction

Making calculator was the last project in the Odin foundations. Before I started, I remember that people from the chat were freaking out that it is very difficult, and it takes weeks. I didn’t know what to expect to be honest. 

With this calculator you can do all the basic operations, like add, subtract, multiply and divide. You can delete one by one or the whole screen. I also added an option for decimal point and percentage. 

I really liked this project it was the first one where I learned how to use the debugger and I have to say it changed my life. If I stumbled onto a problem, I used the debugger, and it was an eye opener every time. 

The design part was definitely enjoyable as well and it is mobile friendly. This is the first design i made.
